# â˜• Java + DSA Learning Journey

Welcome to my Java learning repository!  
This repo tracks my progress as I learn **Java** and **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** by following [Kunal Kushwaha's Java + DSA course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9gnSGHSqcnqNETL0f5MnF0bA3YkJ0jGg).

I'm using this repo to practice, stay consistent, and build strong fundamentals for backend development and DevOps.
